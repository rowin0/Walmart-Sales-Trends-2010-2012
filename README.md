# Walmart Sales Trends 2010-2012
## Project Background
Walmart Inc. is a multinational retail corporation that operates a global chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. Established in 1962, it is recognized as the world’s largest company by revenue.\
With a vast amount of sales data collected from various stores and departments, this project analyzes that data to uncover insights aimed at driving greater commercial success.

Insights and recommendations are provided in the following key areas:
* Sales trends analysis – Examining sales performance across stores and departments, with a focus on comparing holiday vs. non-holiday periods.
* Year-over-year sales comparisons – Evaluating how sales have evolved across different stores and departments over time.
* Key sales drivers – Analyzing external and internal factors that influence sales, such as markdowns, unemployment rates, the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and even temperature.
